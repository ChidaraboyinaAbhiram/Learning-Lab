#🧪 Learning Lab

Learning Lab is my personal development workspace where I experiment with and implement concepts across the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) along with modern frontend technologies.

This repository includes:

MERN stack mini projects

REST API experiments

Backend & database integrations

UI/UX practice builds

Feature prototypes & logic implementations

The purpose of this project is to strengthen my full-stack development skills through continuous hands-on learning and real-world coding practice.

It reflects my focus on:

Building scalable web applications

Understanding frontend–backend interaction

Exploring modern JavaScript ecosystems

Continuous skill improvement
